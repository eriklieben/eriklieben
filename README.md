## 🚀 About Me

I write code for a living and write about code for learning.

As the organizer of [dotnet.amsterdam](https://www.meetup.com/dotnet-amsterdam/), I bring together .NET developers in the Amsterdam area to share knowledge and build community.

My focus is on building **reliable, maintainable software** using programming patterns in .NET.

## 🎤 Community & Content

Beyond code, I'm passionate about building and nurturing developer communities:

- 🎙️ **Community Organizer** — Running [dotnet.amsterdam](https://www.meetup.com/dotnet-amsterdam/), bringing .NET developers together for talks, workshops, and networking
- 📺 **YouTube** — Recording and sharing talks and sessions from our meetups at [@dotnetamsterdam](https://youtube.com/@dotnetamsterdam)
- ✍️ **Blog** — Sharing my experiences and learnings on [eriklieben.com](https://www.eriklieben.com) about software development, programming, and building better software
